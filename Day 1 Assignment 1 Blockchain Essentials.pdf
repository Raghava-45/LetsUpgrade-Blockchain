  DAY 1 BLOCKCHAIN ESSENTIALS ASSIGNMENT 1 
    Q.NO 1 . What is your understanding of blockchain?
       Ans . Blockchain is mix techonolgy of distributed datsbase & cryptography where data is verifiable,unchangeable , tamperproof and immutabe 
             internet 2.0
             Its a ledger kind of a system where the complete history of records are maintained and updated which are immutable. 
             Its a system where one can perform only create or read the date neither one can update or delete the data
   Q.NO 2  . What is the core problem the BlockChain is trying to solve?
      Ans  . The authenticity and credibility of internet , which blockchain is trying  to solve by internet 2.0
   Q.NO 3  . What are the few features BlockChain will give you?
      Ans  . Features of blockchain : 
                               No hacking
                               Huge security boost
                               Data transparency
                               Decentralized
                               verifiable
                               unchangeable
                               Tamper proof and immutable
   Q.NO 4  . What all things does a block chain contain?
      Ans  . A block chain contains : Mining key
                                      Block number 
                                      Transaction records
                                      Previous block signature
   Q.NO 5  . How is the verifiability of Blockchain being attained?
      Ans  . Every block of Blockchain contains the unique Hash key by cryptography encryption of data in it. 
             This unique hash key of every previous block is linked with succesive block of blockchain. 
             If any changes in the data of Block , hashkey of that block  will be differed and the block gets dettached from link 
             Now it is easy for one to check with another blockchain in a distribution channel and can easily identify where the data is tampered and thus verifiability of data is obtained.
